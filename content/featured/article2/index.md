abstract: In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the integrality of Cayley graphs over the dihedral group $D_n=\langle a,b\mid a^n=b^2=1,bab=a^{-1}\rangle$. Moreover, we also obtain some simple sufficient conditions for the integrality of Cayley graphs over $D_n$ in terms of the Boolean algebra of $\langle a\rangle$, from which we find infinite classes of integral Cayley graphs over $D_n$. In particular, we completely determine all integral Cayley graphs over the dihedral group $D_p$ for a prime $p$.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
