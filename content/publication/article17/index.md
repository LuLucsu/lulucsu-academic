abstract: Let G be a connected graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set E(G). For a subset S of V(G), the Steiner distance d(S) of S is the minimum size of a connected subgraph whose vertex set contains ∑S. For an integer k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, the Steiner k-Wiener index SWk(G) is S⊆V(G),|S|=k d(S). In this paper, we introduce some transformations for trees that do not
increase their Steiner k-Wiener index for 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Using these transformations, we get a sharp lower bound on Steiner k-Wiener index for trees with given diameter, and obtain the corresponding extremal graph as well.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
